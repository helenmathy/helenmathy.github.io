                <h2>Interesting facts</h2>

                <p class="facts">Rank - 5th from the sun, twice as large as all the other planets combined. A gigantic gaseous planet, with no surface except for perhaps an Earth sized solid inner core, and an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. A year on Jupiter is equivalent
                    to 12 Earth years, whereas a day lasts only a mere 10 Earth hours. This rapid spin makes Jupiter bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles.<br>Named after the Roman god, Jupiter boasts more than 75 moons.</p>
                <p class="facts">Jupiter's Great Red Spot is in fact a gigantic storm which has been present for over 300 years and measures twice the circumference of Earth. The outer edge spins counterclockwise around its center at speeds of about 430 to 680 km/h. Jupiterâ€™s
                    colourful bands of light and dark are created by strong east-west winds in the planet's upper atmosphere traveling more than 539 km/h. The white clouds are formed from frozen ammonia crystals, while darker clouds consist of various
                    other chemicals.
                    <br>As far as we understand, Jupiter cannot support life forms. Interestingly though a number of Jupiter's moons have oceans beneath their crusts which may be capable of supporting life. Jupiter has been visited by 9 spaceships the
                    most recent of which was Juno which began its observations in 2016. Jupiter recently suffered a meteor strike which was captured, for the first time ever, on camera.</p>
