        <h2>Explore three very different planets within our Solar System.</h2>

        <p class="facts">Each of Earth’s 7 siblings has its own extreme features and crazy phenomena. Farthest from the sun, Neptune boasts the strongest jet stream winds on any of our neighbouring planets. Where or how Neptune creates such winds remains a mystery to
            scientists. Not only is it on the outer edges of our solar system, but it has relatively weak internal heat. Heat being one of the key components required to generate winds of such hurricane force velocity as seen here on Earth.</p>
        <p class="facts">Mercury, on the other hand, lays claim to that of closest to the sun, yet spins at a very slow pace comparatively to the other planets. It also boasts the most extreme wild temperature swings within our solar system. Its day-night cycle is the
            longest in all 8 planets, resulting in all parts of its surface experiencing lengthy periods of intense heat and severe cold.</p>
        <p class="facts">Jupiter’s claim to fame is its large and dominant red spot. Observational records show that over the past 300 years, this spot has in fact been known to fade entirely only to reappear at a later date in exactly the same position. Its cloudy atmospheric
            mask is relatively thin for its size and stature as a gaseous giant, at 50km thick. Unlike Mercury, it is the fastest spinning planet and has a magnetic field 14 times stronger than Earth’s.</p>
